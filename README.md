# Type1d (CarbsCheck) is a personal ongoing project, whose role is to offer type 1 diabetic people a platform to create menues and monitor their carbohydrates level. The project uses languages such as PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and it is being developed in a PHPStorm environment. I use XAMPP and phpmyadmin for the control of the local server and databases. In my project I make use of APIs (the most recent being Edamam). This project was uploaded from my private Gitlab account.

The first page is the index page, which offers the frontend of the login and register. The index file is linked to the server and the db.

Once the user has logged in or registered, they can input names of food or barcodes, to which the program outputs the level of carbohydrates and recommandations of more specific foods (eg you types pizza, the recommandation would be "Did you mean cheese pizza?"). The functionality is in the registration page.

Lastly, the user can create a menu, delete, and update included items.
